# 100 Days of Projects

## Day 1 â€“ Responsive Web Design Project Initiative

### Notes

Although I've been coding for years, I need to build up my projects portfolio and give myself a refresher on basic coding. The best way for me to put my skills to practice is by committing to the #100DaysOfProjects challenge, created by [Ceora](https://twitter.com/ceeoreo_)! She's an Instructor and Learner Advocate at egghead.io and you should follow her on Twitter to get loads of meme inspiration and moere.

Today's notes will feature what I'm learning via freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design Certification track](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) course. With 300 hours of curriculum to cover, I wanted to document my journey in public so that other devs, code newbies and prospective project collaborators can see what Learning in Public is all about!

I'm looking forward to sharing my learnings and project progress with you, and if you'd like to code alongside me let's do it! Tweet your progress [@gerilynhayes](https://twitter.com/gerilynmhayes) and [@100ProjectDays](https://twitter.com/100ProjectDays) using hashtags #100DaysOfProjects and #LearningInPublic.

## LET'S GO!
