# 100 Days of Projects

## Day 1 – Responsive Web Design Project Initiative

Although I've been coding for years, I need to build up my projects portfolio and give myself a refresher on basic coding. The best way for me to put my skills to practice is by committing to the #100DaysOfProjects challenge, created by [Ceora](https://twitter.com/ceeoreo_)! She's an Instructor and Learner Advocate at egghead.io and you should follow her on Twitter to get loads of meme inspiration and moere.

Today's notes will feature what I'm learning via freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design Certification track](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) course. With 300 hours of curriculum to cover, I wanted to document my journey in public so that other devs, code newbies and prospective project collaborators can see what Learning in Public is all about!

I'm looking forward to sharing my learnings and project progress with you, and if you'd like to code alongside me let's do it! Tweet your progress [@gerilynhayes](https://twitter.com/gerilynmhayes) and [@100ProjectDays](https://twitter.com/100ProjectDays) using hashtags #100DaysOfProjects and #LearningInPublic.

## LET'S GO!

### NOTES

*These are general notes; notes can be used by anyone.*

#### Basic HTML and HTML5 curriculum, 28 lessons to complete

[Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/)

To become a web savvy coder, you'll need to know HTML.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. *What does that mean?*

**HyperText Markup Language** is really neat! Think of it as a computing language that tells your web browser how webpages are structured and describes all the cool information on these webpages–because that's exactly what it does! You're literally talking directly to your computer and telling it how you'd like for it to render in the form of a digital medium. *Pretty far out, right?*

That's why understanding this language, and how your computer interprets what you're telling it to do, will be the foundation of your coding and programming experience.

#### Building a simple web page using HTML

The documented code (below) is the result of today's curriculum. To build these items yourself, please visit [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and begin the Responsive Web Design Certification track](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) today!

If you have questions about the resulting code or the process, please tweet me [@gerilynhayes](https://twitter.com/gerilynmhayes) – thanks! 

```
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

We're about to get more descriptive with the HTML tags, starting with `<main>`.

**NOTE**: "HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.

These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read, and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility. The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page." - freeCodeCamp

You'll see below which information is considered "main" or most important.

```
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<main>

<a href="#footer">Jump to Bottom</a>

<img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="cats relaxing">

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

<p>Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched.</p>

</main>
