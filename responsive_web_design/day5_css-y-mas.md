## Day 5 ‚Äì Responsive Web Design | More CSS! Variables y mas

There's a penguin in this lesson, and that's really all I'm focused on at the moment so let's get to it, shall we?

## Waddlin' up to the code party like "Woah!"

## CSS Variables

Mulitple CSS properties can be changed simultaneously when *one value* is changed. **How?** *With CSS Variables, bebe!**

To form a variable, type out two hyphens and a name for your variable. Then, give it a value.

Here's an example:

```
--penguin-skin: #588443;
```

When you use variables, you're telling the browser that you want the same styling property's value to render in different places on the screen. The penguin code is a perfect example of this.

You can also tell the browser which value to put in place of your first value choice. You'll want to do this so that the browser has a *fallback variable* in the event that it cannot find your variable (e.g., your code is mispelled, extra characters in the code, etc.).

*It's like parents always say, "*Ya gotta have a fallback plan!*"

# üéâ Project Time üéâ 

Oh snap! It's time for a project!

Sure, fCC didn't tell you this was *the perfefct opportunity to build your first project*, but that's what **I'm here** for.

Since good people at freeCodeCamp are so generous with their code, I encourage you to copy the HTML and CSS in their module and paste into your CodePen and play with the variables to see how they work *before* moving onto the next lesson.

I'm going to take a little time to reconfigure the code for fCC's original penguin design (*sorry, buddy* üêß). Visit my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/pen/BaaKWNQ) to see what I'm doing with the fCC penguin code! Even though it's not complete, I hope one day I can bring my vision to life. For now, it'll be a work in progress!

Did you rework the original code, too?!

*Ahhhhsome...* Can I please see your handywork? I'd **love** to see what you've come up with! Tweet me [@gerilynhayes](https://twitter.com/gerilynmhayes) and [@100ProjectDays](https://twitter.com/100ProjectDays) so I can take a look at your sweet new design!

## Yo.... ü§î Are we compatible?

Pay close attention to the "Improve Compatability with Browser Fallbacks" module. In it, you will learn why fallbacks are crucial for web browser compatability.

I think it's especially notable here because in the module Internet Explorer is mentioned as a browser that does not support CSS variables. Even though this browser will atomize in the upcoming year, there are plenty of web surfers riding IE's midnight tide. These users have come to expect their web pages to behave properly; we as devs must ensure they do by giving our code fallbacks.

For a deeper dive on code compatibility, study this supplemental resource now: *Introduction to cross browser testing*

## Overall thoughts:

Just when you thought it couldn't get any more fun, CSS give you variables! I'm loving it so far. For now, I need to wrap up this day and get into the holiday weekend spirit.  

Even though there's a 3-day weekend ahead, you can find me tinkering away for Day 6, 7, and 8 because coding is my habit and I want to keep at it everyday! It's so much fun!

How are you doing with the lessons? Sped ahead already? Then, don't let me slow ya down! I want to hear about what you've learned. Tweet me [@gerilynhayes](https://twitter.com/gerilynmhayes) and [@100ProjectDays](https://twitter.com/100ProjectDays) using hashtags #100DaysOfProjects and #LearningInPublic. We can learn from each other, in public!!

ü§ì Until tomorrow, keep on codin'!
