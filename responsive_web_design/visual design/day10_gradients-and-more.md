## NOTES

## Applied Visual Design, 52 lessons to complete

*These are general notes that can be used by anyone.*

### [Introduction to  the Applied Visual Design Challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/)

## Use a CSS Linear Gradient to Create a Striped Element

fCC states:

> The repeating-linear-gradient() function is very similar to linear-gradient() with the major difference that it repeats the specified gradient pattern. 

---

## Create Texture by Adding a Subtle Pattern as a Background Image

fCC states:

> One way to add texture and interest to a background and have it stand out more is to add a subtle pattern. The key is balance, as you don't want the background to stand out too much, and take away from the foreground. The background property supports the url() function in order to link to an image of the chosen texture or pattern. The link address is wrapped in quotes inside the parentheses.

I've done this with my name card [here](https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/pen/VwaQwOr).

## Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Change the Size of an Element

fCC states:

> To change the scale of an element, CSS has the transform property, along with its scale() function.

The example you can plug into your code is:

```
p {
    transform: scale(3);
}

```

This means that your paragraph elements will triple in size.

## Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Scale an Element on Hover

In this module, we're touching on psuedo-classes, again. In the example provided, we're asking the browser to follow a set of instructions that will cause it to render a `div` to scale up by 1.1 in size when the cursor hovers over it. Here's what the code looks like:

```
  div:hover {
    transform: scale(1.1);
  }
```

Visit MDN web docs for more information about [psuedo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes).

## Use the CSS Transform Property skewX to Skew an Element Along the X-Axis

The X-axis is horizontal.

Plug this code snippet into yours:

```
p {
    transform: skewX(-32deg);
}
```

---

## Use the CSS Transform Property skewY to Skew an Element Along the Y-Axis

The Y-axis is vertical.

```
  #top {
    background-color: red;
    transform: skewY(-10deg);
  }
```

## Create a Graphic Using CSS

This is pretty cool! In the example provided by fCC, we learn that we can create shapes using CSS selectors and properties. We work primarily with `border-radius`, `box-shadow` and their respective values for this challenge. See my results via [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/pen/BaKwJPp)! It should look similar to your own     üåô

## Overall thoughts:

Had to cut this lesson short today! I ran out of time, but I'll be back tmrw :)
