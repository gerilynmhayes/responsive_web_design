## Day 5 – Responsive Web Design | More CSS! Variables y mas

Starting the project a little later than expected. Today's late start is thanks to a worthwhile all-night WordPress site building session that will be launching by the end of next week. I'm very excited to share the website with you once it ships. For now, it's CSS refresher time!

## Break time! – Responsive Web Design | Taking a much-needed rest during Labor Day Weekend

Spent some quality down time at home instead of coding. Although I'd love to get my hands on some more CSS and tinkering away at a cool new project, I wanted to relax. The time spent was worthwhile, and I needed to unplug for a bit.

I'm looking forward to jumping back in tomorrow to learn more concepts. 

#### This does not count as day 6 of the project since no actions were taken today.

Didn't plan on coding this weekend, but here I am! Even though today is a holiday, I'm in the midst of a learning session that just won't quit so let's hop into another week of learning with the focus to get a web page built by the end of the 100 days!

## Day 7, continued – Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design, continued

And just like that, I kept on coding through the tutorial. During my note taking I got a bit experimental and went offroad and navigated into project territory! See what I came up with here on my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/pen/VwaQwOr).

## Day 7 and 8 (combined) – Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design, continued

Having a hard time pulling myself away from my CSS name card design, I kept on moving forward with the Applied Visual Design portion of the fCC tutorial. You can review my code in my GitHub repository titled "*name card*" [here](https://github.com/gerilynmhayes/name-card).

## Day 9 – Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design, continued

Yesterday I played with relative position of elements to see how this variable impacted my design layouts. Groovy stuff, indeed! I'm looking forward to jumping into the other values of position such as 'absolute' and 'fixed'. To see my results on any of the projects that I mention in my notes, review my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/) profile.

## Day 10 – Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design, continued

Phew! What a productive day! I'm happy to finally squeeze in a bit of coding time before taking a nice nature walk and hopping into my book club meeting this evening.

This afternoon, I'm still working with a few styling elements in CSS and I'm pretty pumped about it!

## Day 11 – Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design, continued

Yesterday was an expansion on color. Today is about applying that knowledge to complex shapes and animation!

If you're still following along and coding with me, I hope that you're progressing. In fact, if you're well beyond me at this point: KEEP GOING! I'm rooting for you    👍🏾

For now, I'm going to pop on some good tunes and get to work. Let's get it!

## Day 12 – Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design, continued

Ugggh... I have a massive headache that just won't quit so I'm going to take a break today. If it goes away, I'll hop back into my lessons this evening. For now, I am very happy with my progress so far. You can see yesterday's notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/gerilynmhayes/responsive_web_design/blob/master/responsive_web_design/day11_complex-shapes_animation.md) if you'd like to get more insight on color theory and animation in CSS.

## Day 13 – Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design, continued

Took another breather today. I'm thinking that weekends are going to have to be true weekends instead of coding-based weekends. I think only time will tell. You're free to review my latest set of notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/gerilynmhayes/responsive_web_design/blob/master/responsive_web_design/day11_complex-shapes_animation.md) about color theory and animation in CSS.

I'll see you bright and early tomorrow!

## Day 14 – Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design, continued

This weekend was a weird one, only because I couldn't figure out how to balance coding with sleeping lol! Fortunately, I've decided to keep my weekdays and weekends separate. I actually DO benefit from not coding on the weekends. Now, my mind is clear and ready to take on new coding challenges. I want to keep this mode of operation, going forward.

Today, I'm jumping into animation-iteration and playing with timing. Tomorrow, I'm wrapping up the animation portion of the curriculum and moving on to the Bezier Curve for smooth, natural moving digital elements. Who knew HTML and CSS would be this much fun?!

## Day 15 – Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design, Applied Accessibility

Another late start, but that's okay! I'm here and ready to wrap up the Applied Visual Design portion of the curriculum. Next, I'll move into Applied Accessibility–an essential factor when building websites of any kind.

## Day 16 – Responsive Web Design | Applied Accessibility, continued

Wow – what a productive day! With so many things to cross off my priority list, I barely had time to get into today's tutorial. And even though I'm about to call it a night in roughly 30 minutes, I'm going get at least one lesson in before the day is through.

Let's jump right into the lesson titled "Use Headings to Show Hierarchical Relationships of Content"

## Day 17 – Responsive Web Design | Applied Accessibility, continued

I. am. spent. And I need to go to bed. While I've been making incredible strides with my client-centered projects, there comes a time when you have to shut down the laptop sooner than planned and just hit the hay. So, that's what I'm going to do. AND from now on, I'm only going to take these coding tutorials in the mornings because these 10-hour workdays are long enough as it is. See you in the morning, coder!

## Day 18 – Responsive Web Design | Applied Accessibility, continued

Yesterday/last night, my brain reached its capacity for taking in new information because I was literally exhausted.

After a good night's sleep and a hearty protein-rich breakfast, I happy to get back into accessibility with a clear mind.

## Day 19 – Responsive Web Design | Applied Accessibility, continued

After taking time to relax this weekend, I'm ready to wrap up these accessibility lessons. So far, I've learned that screen readers need clear, concise code that has semantic meaning in order for them to give individuals experiencing disabilities the best web experience. Looking forward to learning more about making the web a more accessible place.

## Day 20  – Responsive Web Design | Introduction to the Responsive Web Design Challenges

YES! The coursework I've been waiting for. Looking forward to diving into media queries, responsive design, and so much more. Even after months of digging into responsive with Skillcrush, I feel like this refresher is really supplemental to my ongoing learning.

Here's to another day of coding!

## Day 21 and 22 – Responsive Web Design | Responsive Web Design Challenges

Time has a funny way of being simultaneously ample and fleeting. This was never more obvious to me than yesterday when the hours literally rolled away during some of the most challenging coding work I've done in a while. Fortunately, I was able to fix unexpected navigation errors in some existing code on a client's Squarespace site, as well as troubleshoot for another client's WordPress. It was a heavy lift, and somehow I still got in a bit of coding word. Although I missed updating everyone about this, I am happy to report that both Day 21 and Day 22 will be combined since I was otherwise indisposed due to actual real-world coding challenges!

This whole dev thing is nifty!

## Day 23 – Responsive Web Design | Introduction to the CSS Grid Challenges

Today was a day of errands so I'm not much for getting a solid tutorial in, BUT there's no way I'm going to fall behind on this commitment. So, I'm jumping in to start learning more about CSS Grid.

While I've seen grid, I don't have a full grasp on it. I think this lesson will be worthwhile. Let's see what the first installation teaches us, shall we?

## Day 25 – Responsive Web Design | Introduction to the CSS Grid Challenges
 
 Learned something new and handy today: It's best to use CSS Grid for complex layouts and Flexbox when considering alignment. This is helpful for the upcoming forms page project that I will build * after * redesigning my tribute page featuring one of my all-time favorite actors and humanitarians Mr. Rainn Wilson.

https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/pen/KKVMqZe

I'd like to fine-tune the existing code with what I've learned; there are plenty of opportunities for improvement!

What's even more encouraging is that I'm tracking to not just have one project completed by the end of the 100 Days, but FIVE. Can't wait!!

## Day 26 – Responsive Web Design | Introduction to the CSS Grid Challenges

Alignment in CSS Grid is a lot to remember. The best way to retain the information is to build web pages that require the use of this type of code. I'm looking forward to using it on the Forms Page project that's coming up.
