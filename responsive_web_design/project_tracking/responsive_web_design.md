## Day 3 – Responsive Web Design | The Nightmare Trifecta (CSS)

Covering off on `padding`, `margin` and `border`–or The Nightmare Trifecta, as I like to call it. This one should be... * *ahem* * worthwhile.

## Day 4 – Responsive Web Design | More CSS! Back to CatPhotoApp

Covering off on a multitude of properties and understanding attribute selectors. This is going to be a good way to work with "The Nightmare Trifeca" from Day 3 and other styling properties and their values.

## Day 5 – Responsive Web Design | More CSS! Variables y mas

Starting the project a little later than expected. Today's late start is thanks to a worthwhile all-night WordPress site building session that will be launching by the end of next week. I'm very excited to share the website with you once it ships. For now, it's CSS refresher time!

## Break time! – Responsive Web Design | Taking a much-needed rest during Labor Day Weekend

Spent some quality down time at home instead of coding. Although I'd love to get my hands on some more CSS and tinkering away at a cool new project, I wanted to relax. The time spent was worthwhile, and I needed to unplug for a bit.

I'm looking forward to jumping back in tomorrow to learn more concepts. 

#### This does not count as day 6 of the project since no actions were taken today.

## Day 7, continued – Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design, continued

And just like that, I kept on coding through the tutorial. During my note taking I got a bit experimental and went offroad and navigated into project territory! See what I came up with here on my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/pen/VwaQwOr).

## Day 7 and 8 (combined) – Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design, continued

Having a hard time pulling myself away from my CSS name card design, I kept on moving forward with the Applied Visual Design portion of the fCC tutorial. You can review my code in my GitHub repository titled "*name card*" [here](https://github.com/gerilynmhayes/name-card).
