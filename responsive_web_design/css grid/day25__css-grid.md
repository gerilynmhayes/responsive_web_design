## Align an Item Horizontally using `justify-self`

The content inside the grid items is called `cell`. Cells can be aligned horizontally using `justify-items`. Since the `justify-items` default value is `stretch`, all the content will take up the width of the cell.

Other values you can use are:

`start`: content aligned to the left of the cell.

`center`: content aligned to the center of the cell.

`end`: content aligned to the right of the cell.
