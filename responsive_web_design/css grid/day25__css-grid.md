## Align an Item Horizontally using `justify-self`

The content inside the grid items is called `cell`. Cells can be aligned horizontally using `justify-items`. Since the `justify-items` default value is `stretch`, all the content will take up the width of the cell.

Other values you can use are:

`start`

`center`

`end`: content aligned to the right of the cell.

## Align an Item Vertically using `align-self`

## Align All Items Horizontally using `justify-items`
