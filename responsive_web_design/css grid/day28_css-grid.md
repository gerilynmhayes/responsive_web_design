# 100 Days of Projects

## Day 28 & 29 â€“ Responsive Web Design | CSS Grid

Today, I am focusing on creating flexible layouts using both `auto-fill` and `auto-fit`, media queries for responsive layout creation, and creating grids within grids.

## Let's GRID it!   ðŸ¤“

## Create Flexible Layouts Using `auto-fill`

`auto-fill` is a option for the `repeat` function, allowing us to automatically insert however many columns and rows into containers. They can be of any size *depending on the size of the container*.

To create flexible layouts, you'll want to combine both `auto-fill` with `minmax`. Here's an example:

```
repeat(auto-fill, minmax(60px, 1fr));
```

The code above means that when the container size changes, the code will insert columns sized 60px and stretch them until another can be inserted.

Here's a note to remember from fCC:

> If your container can't fit all your items on one row, it will move them down to a new one.

It's best to test this code in the challenge [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-grid/create-flexible-layouts-using-auto-fill) to see how it works.

## Create Flexible Layouts Using auto-fit

The key difference between `auto-fit` and `auto-fill` is that when the container size exceeds the sixe of all the items combined, `auto-fill` will continuously insert empty rows or columns while pushing items to the side. `auto-fit` collapses the empty columns or rows while stretching the items to fit the size of the container.

Here's a note to remember from fCC:

> If your container can't fit all your items on one row,it will move them down to a new one.

From today's challenge, you'll see how this code styles to layout:

```
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(60px, 1fr));
```

## Use Media Queries to Create Responsive Layouts

To make websites more responsive, we want to use media queries when using CSS Grid. We can use "media queries to rearrange the grid areas, change dimensions of a grid, and rearrange the placement of items."

## Use Media Queries to Create Responsive Layouts

fCC states:

> CSS Grid can be an easy way to make your site more responsive by using media queries to rearrange grid areas, change dimensions of a grid, and rearrange the placement of items.

## Create Grids within Grids

fCC states:

> Turning an element into a grid only affects the behavior of its direct descendants. So by turning a direct descendant into a grid, you have a grid within a grid.
