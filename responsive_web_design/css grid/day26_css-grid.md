*These are general notes that can be used by anyone.*

## Align an Item Vertically using `align-self`

`align-self` is used to align items vertically, using the same values as `justify-self`: `center`, `start`, and `end`.

## Align All Items Horizontally using `justify-items`

When you'd like all the items in the CSS Grid to have the same alignment, use `justify-items` to align all the items horizontally on the grid container. You can use the `center`, `start`, and `end` values, and all the items will align accordingly.

## Align All Items Vertically using `align-items`

When you'd like all the items in the CSS Grid to all align vertically, use `align-items`.

### Overall thoughts:

Alignment in CSS Grid is a lot to remember. The best way to retain the information is to build web pages that require the use of this type of code. I'm looking forward to using it on the Forms Page project that's coming up.

For now, I'm going to jump into some client work and write a few emails. Talk soon, coder!!
