## Day 24 – Responsive Web Design | CSS Grid

Pleased with my decision to code exclusively during the week, I am happy to be back in front of my laptop to study the power that is CSS Grid.

## Off (well, on) the Grid   🤓

## Introduction to the CSS Grid Challenges

From freeCodeCamp:

> CSS Grid helps you easily build complex web designs. It works by turning an HTML element into a grid container with rows and columns for you to place children elements where you want within the grid.

## Create Your First CSS Grid

Using CSS, we can transform our HTML elements into grid containers by using the `display` property and setting it's value to `grid`. When we do this, we are setting ourselves up to use other CSS Grid properties.

### Overall thoughts:

Nothing much to report since I've had a very long day and my brain is definitely in need of food and several rerun episodes of New Girl and The Mindy Project.

I will catch YOU on the flippity flip!
