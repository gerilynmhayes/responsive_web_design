## Day 4 â€“ Responsive Web Design | Responsive Web Design | More CSS! Back to CatPhotoApp

Although I was feeling anxious about yesterday's lesson, I am feeling more confident about what the fCC coursework will deliver.

I'm eager to see how much progress I can make with this coursework.

## Diving Right In!

## CSS Selectors

The attribute selector matches and styles elements with a specific attribute value.

Example given by fCC show us that the code changes the margins of all elements with the attribute `type` and a corresponding value of `radio`:

```
[type='radio'] {
  margin: 20px 0px 20px 0px;
}
```

## Units of Measure

fCC tells us that, "The two main types of length units are absolute and relative. Absolute units tie to physical units of length. For example, `in` and `mm` refer to inches and millimeters, respectively. Absolute length units approximate the actual measurement on a screen, but there are some differences depending on a screen's resolution."

fCC also tells us about `em` or `rem`: "Relative units, such as `em` or `rem`, are relative to another length value. For example, `em` is based on the size of an element's font. If you use it to set the `font-size` property itself, it's relative to the parent's `font-size`."

Visit the [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/pen/BaKwJPp) for the "Nightmare Trifecta" to see how these units of measure work.
