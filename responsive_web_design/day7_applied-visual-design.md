# 100 Days of Projects

## ## Day 7 â€“ Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design 

Happy Monday! It's time to give back into the groove of coding a responsive website using the freeCodeCamp curriculum. I'm looking forward to completing this project (hopefully in less than a hundred days) so...

## Let's Get This Party Started!

## Introduction to course

fCC states:

> Visual Design [...] combines typography, color theory, graphics, animation, and page layout to help deliver a site's message. The visual design of the page can influence its presentation and a user's experience.

### Course objective: *Learn basic tools to create visual designs.*

## Create Visual Balance Using the `text-align` Property

There are four values you can use with aligning your text:

`text-align: justify;` â€“ text will start on left side of box and end on the right side of box

`text-align: center;` â€“ text will be centered within box

`text-align: right;` â€“ text will be right aligned within box

`text-align: left;` â€“ text will be centered within box

## Adjust the Width and Height of an Element Using the width Property

Add width and height to the card by typing `width` and `height` with their respective values into your code editor. It look like this:

```
width: 289px;
```

and

```
height: 10px;
```

Using the fCC example, we're going to update the `.fullCard` element with the width property and the heading. Feel free to reference my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/pen/VwaQwOr) to see the code I wrote to adjust width.

As you continue to follow the coding tutorial, you'll find several HTML and CSS properties that you'll enjoy styling your code with. 

## Overall thoughts:

This is my favorite part of the tutorial: *Styling*. I'm enjoying turning HTML into a sleek looking design with CSS.

I'm looking forward to revisiting backgrounds and color theory!
