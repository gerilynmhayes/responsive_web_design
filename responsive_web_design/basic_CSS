# 100 Days of Projects

## Day 2 â€“ Responsive Web Design | Basic CSS

Today I'm starting the freeCodeCamp's [Introduction to Basic CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) portion of the Responsive Web Design course. I'm excited to revisit the basics of CSS in this lesson. I've always enjoyed styling sites so I'm looking forward to updating the code for the [CatPhotoApp](https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/pen/mdPMpGO) project.

Remember: If you'd like to code alongside me let's do it! Tweet your progress [@gerilynhayes](https://twitter.com/gerilynmhayes) and [@100ProjectDays](https://twitter.com/100ProjectDays) using hashtags #100DaysOfProjects and #LearningInPublic.

## IT'S TIME TO ROCK 'N' ROLL!
