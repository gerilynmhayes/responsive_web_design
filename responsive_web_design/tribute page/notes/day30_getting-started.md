# 100 Days of Projects

## Day 30 â€“ Responsive Web Design | Introduction to the Responsive Web Design Projects: Build a Tribute Page

Today's the day!! I'm going to start my very first project challenge: Build a Tribute Page.

Although I've already built one for Rainn Wilson, I'm going to create another one for Neil deGrasse Tyson. I think he's super cool! So, that's what I'll be working on for the next few days or so. And I'm going to post my code, my notes, and the end result on GitHub and Twitter.

Hooray!!

## NOTES

## Introduction to the Responsive Web Design Projects: Build a Tribute Page, 1 project to complete

### [Instructions from freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page):

User Story #1: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.

User Story #2: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

User Story #3: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

User Story #4: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".

User Story #5: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.

User Story #6: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

User Story #7: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

User Story #8: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

User Story #9: The img element should be centered within its parent element.
