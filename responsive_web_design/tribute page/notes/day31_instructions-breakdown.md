# 100 Days of Projects

## Day 30 + 31 (combo) â€“ Responsive Web Design | Introduction to the Responsive Web Design Projects: Build a Tribute Page

So, yesterday got away from me and I only did a minimal amount of coding. That's not going to stop me from hopping right back into this project!

I'm going to start off by reviewing the instructions and then make a design plan. I didn't do that last time and ended up feeling extremely overwhelmed. Maybe I'll use Asana to build tasks for this process? Not sure yet. But let's start small and tackle the instructions.

## NOTES

## Introduction to the Responsive Web Design Projects: Build a Tribute Page, 1 project to complete

### [Instructions from freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page):

(I neglected to lead Day 30 with these instructions so I'm revisiting them now.)

> Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.

Fortunately, I already have a CodePen account so I'm set there.

Taking a look at the example project page, I think that I will need the following elements:

- Stylized body element with consideration to the background coloring
- A responsive header image with caption
- An unordered list with bulleted list items
- An element or `<div>` with a stylized border that houses the header and the unordered list

> Fulfill the below [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

I'm not clear on what "user stories" are so I need to research that now.

**Takes a few minutes to find reliable sources.**

Okay, I think I've got it! Based on the resources I've found, user stories are the layperson terms used to describe the end user's (intended) experience with software.

[resource is here](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories)

The "user stories" listed at the outset of this project feature layperson terminology to make building the webpage easy to understand. Or at least that's the theory!

Side note: I think that this is a very smart way to help burgeoning coders and programmers develop soft skills. By not giving line-by-line coding instructions, the student must describe the instructions for themselves. Very smart!

Well played, freeCodeCamp.

> You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

I don't plan to use JS for this; only HTML and CSS.

### User Stories

**User Story #1**: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding `id="main"`, which contains all other elements.

**User Story #2**: I should see an element with a corresponding `id="title"`, which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

**User Story #3**: I should see a `div` element with a corresponding `id="img-div"`.

**User Story #4**: Within the `img-div` element, I should see an `img` element with a corresponding `id="image"`.

**User Story #5**: Within the `img-div` element, I should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `img-div`.

**User Story #6**: I should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

**User Story #7**: I should see an `a` element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of `target` and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. `target="_blank"`).

**User Story #8**: The `img` element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

**User Story #9**: The `img` element should be centered within its parent element.
