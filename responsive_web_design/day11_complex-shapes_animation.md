# 100 Days of Projects

## Day 11 – Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design, continued

Yesterday was an expansion on color. Today is about applying that knowledge to complex shapes and animation!

## Let's move it, move it!

## Create a More Complex Shape Using CSS and HTML

fCC states:

> You need to understand the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. These pseudo-elements are used to add something before or after a selected element.

When you want to add something to an element, you'll want to use the before and after psuedo-elements. fCC says that for these psuedo-elements to work properly, both `::before` and `::after` must have a defined `content` property.

**NOTE**: It's important to remember that when we're making shapes, we will need to use an empty string as the value for the `content` property.

In the example provided by our fCC instructors, you'll learn how to form a heart (pun pun pun). ♥️  Compare your results against mine here in my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/pen/BaKwJPp); we should have a similiar heart-shaped design!

If not, review the module again and watch the freeCodeCamp video explanation.

## Learn How the CSS @keyframes and animation Properties Work

Animating elements requestions the correct animation properties and the `@keyframe` rule. Although we only touch on `animation-name` and `animation-duration` in this lesson, there are *eight animation properties* available for our use (listed below).

- animation-name: none
- animation-duration: 0s
- animation-timing-function: ease
- animation-delay: 0s
- animation-iteration-count: 1
- animation-direction: normal
- animation-fill-mode: none
- animation-play-state: running

Eventually, all we'll need to use is `animation` which the shorthand for all of the properties.

(code lines are from the good people at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation))

It's important to remember this key statement from fCC about `animation` and `@keyframes`:

> The animation properties control how the animation should behave and the @keyframes rule controls what happens during that animation.

`@keyframes` will tell the browser the exact action the animation will make over a specified duration. fCC explains further by stating:

> This is done by giving CSS properties for specific "frames" during the animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%.

Naturally, I went to my 'nightmare trifecta' sandbox and tinkered with the properties and values. You can see my results [here](https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/pen/BaKwJPp).

## Overall thoughts:

These lessons are incredibly fun! Once the day gets in full swing, I hope that I'll be able to come back over to freeCodeCamp and finish out the rest of the lessons. I'm realy enjoying myself much more than my first trial with these lessons. I hope you are, too!

For now, I've got to run    🏃🏾‍♀️
