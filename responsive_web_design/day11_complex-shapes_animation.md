## Create a More Complex Shape Using CSS and HTML

fCC states:

> You need to understand the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. These pseudo-elements are used to add something before or after a selected element.

When you want to add something to an element, you'll want to use the before and after psuedo-elements. fCC says that for these psuedo-elements to work properly, both `::before` and `::after` must have a defined `content` property.

**NOTE**: It's important to remember that when we're making shapes, we will need to use an empty string as the value for the `content` property.

In the example provided by our fCC instructors, you'll learn how to form a heart (pun pun pun). ♥️  Compare your results against mine here in my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/pen/BaKwJPp); we should have a similiar heart-shaped design!

If not, review the module again and watch the freeCodeCamp video explanation.
