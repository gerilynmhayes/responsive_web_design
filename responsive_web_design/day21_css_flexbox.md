# 100 Days of Projects

## Day 21 ‚Äì Responsive Web Design | Introduction to the CSS Flexbox Challenges

While it's always great to get a few projects knocked out by the end of the day, it's even better to have an hour left over to jump into coding.

That's why I'm going to get a headstart on Day 21 right now (it's still technically Day 20, but it's alllll goood). Let's go!

## Introduction to the CSS Flexbox Challenges

From freeCodeCamp:

> A website's **User Interface ("UI")** has two components. First, there are the *visual elements*, such as colors, fonts, and images. Second, there is the *placement or positioning* of those elements. In Responsive Web Design, a **_UI layout must accommodate many different browsers and devices accessing the content_**.

> CSS3 introduced **Flexible Boxes**, or **flexbox**, to create page layouts for a dynamic UI. It is a layout mode that arranges elements in a predictable way for different screen sizes and browsers. While somewhat new, *all popular modern browsers support flexbox*. This section covers how to use flexbox and the different layout options it offers.

## Use `display: flex` to Position Two Boxes

According to fCC, when you place the CSS property `display: flex;` on an element, it allows the developer (*that's you*) to use other flex properties to build a responsive web page.

We use the code `display: flex;` to do so.

## Add Flex Superpowers to the Tweet Embed

It's best to see how the code works by taking the challenge [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/css-flexbox/add-flex-superpowers-to-the-tweet-embed).

## Use the flex-direction Property to Make a Row

When you add `display:flex` to an element, you're turning it into a flex container making "it possible to align any children of that element into rows and columns."
