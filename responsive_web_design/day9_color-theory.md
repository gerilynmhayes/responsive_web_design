# 100 Days of Projects

## Day 9 – Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design, continued

Now that we've move on from positioning, it's time to get into color theory. This isn't my strong suit so I'm very happy to learn more about this design topic.

## Colors are fun!

## Learn about Complementary Colors

fCC states:

> On a website, color can draw attention to content, evoke emotions, or create visual harmony. Using different combinations of colors can really change the look of a website, and a lot of thought can go into picking a color palette that works with your content.

> The color wheel is a useful tool to visualize how colors relate to each other - it's a circle where similar hues are neighbors and different hues are farther apart. When two colors are opposite each other on the wheel, they are called complementary colors. They have the characteristic that if they are combined, they "cancel" each other out and create a gray color. However, when placed side-by-side, these colors appear more vibrant and produce a strong visual contrast.

fCC also provides us with an example of complementary colors in hex code:

```
red (#FF0000) and cyan (#00FFFF)
green (#00FF00) and magenta (#FF00FF)
blue (#0000FF) and yellow (#FFFF00)
```

## Learn about Tertiary Colors

fCC states:

> These secondary colors happen to be the complement to the primary color not used in their creation, and are opposite to that primary color on the color wheel. For example, magenta is made with red and blue, and is the complement to green.

> Tertiary colors are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors. For example, within the RGB color model, red (primary) and yellow (secondary) make orange (tertiary). This adds six more colors to a simple color wheel for a total of twelve.

The following note is very important to consider:

> There are various methods of selecting different colors that result in a harmonious combination in design. One example that can use tertiary colors is called the split-complementary color scheme. This scheme starts with a base color, then pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to its complement. The three colors provide strong visual contrast in a design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.

## Adjust the Color of Various Elements to Complementary Colors

fCC states: 

>The Complementary Colors challenge showed that opposite colors on the color wheel can make each other appear more vibrant when placed side-by-side. However, the strong visual contrast can be jarring if it's overused on a website, and can sometimes make text harder to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background. In practice, one of the colors is usually dominant and the complement is used to bring visual attention to certain content on the page.

## Adjust the Hue of a Color

`hsl` – *hue*, *saturation*, and *light*

**Hue** – This is what we think of as 'color'. "In hsl(), hue uses a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the circle is given as a value between 0 and 360."

**Saturation**  – This is the amount of gray in a color. "A fully saturated color has no gray in it, and a minimally saturated color is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage with 100% being fully saturated."

**Lightness** – This is the amount of white and black in a color. "A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) to 100% (white), where 50% is the normal color."

Examples provided by fCC:

```
cyan	hsl(180, 100%, 50%)
blue	hsl(240, 100%, 50%)
magenta	hsl(300, 100%, 50%)
```

## Adjust the Tone of a Color

fCC states: 

> Mixing white with a pure hue creates a tint of that color, and adding black will make a shade. Alternatively, a tone is produced by adding gray or by both tinting and shading. Recall that the 's' and 'l' of hsl() stand for saturation and lightness, respectively. The saturation percent changes the amount of gray and the lightness percent determines how much white or black is in the color. This is useful when you have a base hue you like, but need different variations of it.

Also note that "*all elements have a default `background-color` of `transparent`.*"

## Overall thoughts:

Oooh, yeah! I'm loving positioning. This is great fun. Now, I'm going to create a new document since this portion of the tutorial is wrapped up.

Now, we're about to get into some more color theory!
