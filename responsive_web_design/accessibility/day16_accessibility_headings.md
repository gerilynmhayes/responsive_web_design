I'm exhausted. BUT coding before the day is done will put me at ease. So, I'm going to get right to it.

## Use Headings to Show Hierarchical Relationships of Contentt

Ever heard of "workhorse" tags? Well, that's what headings are. Here's a better explaination of what that term means:

> Headings (`h1` through `h6` elements) are workhorse tags that help provide structure and labeling to your content. Screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page so the user gets a summary. This means it is important for the heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, ***not be picked merely for their size values***. - fCC

To tell the screen reader the type of information your heading tags contain, you must give them **semantic meaning*.

Another key thing to remember is this:

> One final point, each page should always have one (and only one) h1 element, which is the main subject of your content. This and the other headings are used in part by search engines to understand the topic of the page.

## Overall thoughts:

Having had a bit of a challenging day (in a good way), I wanted to get at least a few minutes of this tutorial squeezed in before bedtime. Tomorrow is going to be a big day, and I need a lot of rest.

For now, you can grab my notes on GitHub right[here](https://github.com/gerilynmhayes/responsive_web_design/tree/master/responsive_web_design) and as always you can tweet me [@gerilynhayes](https://twitter.com/gerilynmhayes).

👋🏾  Until the morning, keep on codin'!
