# 100 Days of Projects

## Day 15 – Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design, Applied Accessibility

I'm excited about wrapping up the Applied Visual Design component of this tutorial. I've learned so much, and have been able to retain more thanks to my extensive notetaking and by asking myself questions about the concepts I'm learning. Here's to deep learning and moving forward with web accessibility!

## It's time to learn!

## Animate Elements at Variable Rates, Animate Multiple Elements at Variable Rates

(Combined challenges)

Changing the animation rate for an element is a take on our previous `@keyframes` lessons. In the fCC example, we're going to change the animation rate of just one of the elements. Please take a look at the [variable rates challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/animate-elements-at-variable-rates) and follow the instructions. You'll see that by changing only one of the element's keyframes rate, you're creating a variable rate for the elements.

To see how I used the code in this challenge, please visit my CodePen [here](https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/pen/VwaQwOr). I encourage you to share your code with me via Twitter [@gerilynhayes](https://twitter.com/gerilynmhayes) – I'd love to see what you've done with the animation properties!

## Change Animation Timing with Keywords

> The `animation-timing-function` property controls how quickly an animated element changes over the duration of the animation. - freeCodeCamp

## Learn How Bezier Curves Work

This concept is extensive so I'm going to refer to the lesson directly here: [Bezier Curve](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/learn-how-bezier-curves-work), [Bezier Curve to move a graphic](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/use-a-bezier-curve-to-move-a-graphic), and [Make Motion More Natural Using a Bezier Curve](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-visual-design/make-motion-more-natural-using-a-bezier-curve).

## Congratulations! You've Completed the First Portion of the freeCodeCamp Tutorial!!

Now, let's move on the second portion that focuses on a web essential: **Accessibility**.

# Introduction to the Applied Accessibility Challenges

freeCodeCamp has an excellent definition for accessibility with reasons why it's essential for all websites, no matter how big or small:

> "Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities.

> Websites should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless of a user's abilities or resources. Some users rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software. Other users may be able to navigate through a site only using a keyboard. Keeping the needs of various users in mind when developing your project can go a long way towards creating an open web.

Resources on Accessibility are listed below:

- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-accessibility)

- [W3C Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/)

- [WP Engine - eBook](https://wpengine.com/resources/accessibility-wordpress/)

I also want to point out that while accessibility deserves its own tutorial, the freeCodeCamp curriculum will cover off on the following to get our feet wet in the deep end of the pool:

1. Have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup
2. Ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content
3. Create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly

🏊🏾‍♀️  Let's dive right in, shall we?

## Add a Text Alternative to Images for Visually Impaired Accessibility

If you're an Instagram enthusiast like me, you've probably seen their implementation of `Alt` text. This is a great thing for technology users with a variety of impairments. The reason is because "`Alt` text describes the content of the image and provides a text-alternative for it. This helps in cases where the image fails to load or can't be seen by a user. It's also used by search engines to understand what an image contains to include it in search results."

What's even better is that it's *super easy* for us devs to implement into our website content. See for yourself when you take the very first challenge [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-accessibility/add-a-text-alternative-to-images-for-visually-impaired-accessibility).

## Know When Alt Text Should be Left Blank

In many cases, I've left out `Alt` text when an image is purely decorative. fCC makes great recommendations on when to use–and not to use–`alt` text [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/applied-accessibility/know-when-alt-text-should-be-left-blank).

**Note**: > In situations when an image is already explained with text content, or does not add meaning to a page, the `img` still needs an `alt` attribute, but it can be set to an empty string.

## Overall thoughts:

This is a good stopping point for the strides made with Visual Design and Accessibility. Tomorrow, I'm going to learn how to use headings to show hierarchical relationships, make screen reader navigation simple for the visually impaired, and how code can improve audio content accessibility.

I'm excited, and if you've been following along with me, I'm excited for you too!

Get the next set of notes via my GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/gerilynmhayes/responsive_web_design/tree/master/responsive_web_design) and if you're feeling stuck or just want someone to chat with on your journey, tweet me [@gerilynhayes](https://twitter.com/gerilynmhayes).

👋🏾  Until tomorrow, keep on codin'!
