# 100 Days of Projects

## Day 9 ‚Äì Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design

Positioning is an essential part of website layouts and I'm hoping to master it. With plenty of practice and deep note taking, I think that I'm well on my way! Now if only I could wrap my mind around "offset"...

## It's study time!

## Lock an Element to its Parent with Absolute Positioning

Yesterday, we learned about `relative` position.

Today, we're learning about `absolute` positioning, which "locks the element in place relative to its parent container". When this happens, we're removing the element from the normal document flow and causing the other surrounding elements to ignore it. To adjust the newly positioned element, we want to use `offset` properties `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`.

## Lock an Element to the Browser Window with Fixed Positioning

`fixed` positioning is a subset of `absolute` positioning in that it "locks an element relative to the browser window" and uses `offset` properties. It also causes the element to be removed from the normal document flow.

**NOTE**: *Fixed elements will not move on scroll. I tend to lean on this for my navigation menus for WordPress sites because I like the way it looks.*  ü§ì

## Push Elements Left or Right with the float Property

The `float` property is a positioning type. "Floating elements are removed from the normal flow of a document and pushed to either the `left` or `right` of their containing parent element. It's commonly used with the `width` property to specify how much horizontal space the floated element requires."

## Change the Position of Overlapping Elements with the z-index Property

fCC states:

> When elements are positioned to overlap (i.e. using position: absolute | relative | fixed | sticky), the element coming later in the HTML markup will, by default, appear on the top of the other elements. However, the z-index property can specify the order of how elements are stacked on top of one another. It must be an integer (i.e. a whole number and not a decimal), and higher values for the z-index property of an element move it higher in the stack than those with lower values.

## Center an Element Horizontally Using the margin Property

Ooooh! Margin!! In my WordPress projects, `margin` comes up *all the time*. It's good to know that I can use this property to center my elements horizontally.

Apparently, I just need to type in `auto` as a variable to my `margin` property.

**NOTE**: "This method works for images, too. Images are inline elements by default, but can be changed to block elements when you set the display property to block."

I wonder if it will work on the name card I've designed     ü§î If you're curious to see if it worked, visit my CodePen [here](https://codepen.io/gerilynmhayes/pen/VwaQwOr).

## Overall thoughts:

Oooh, yeah! I'm loving positioning. This is great fun. Now, I'm going to create a new document since this portion of the tutorial is wrapped up.

Now, we're about to get into some more color theory!
