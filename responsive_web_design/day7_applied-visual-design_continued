## ## Day 7 â€“ Responsive Web Design | Applied Visual Design 

Sooooo.... I kinda skipped ahead and took several steps to get to where I am now in the freeCodeCamp tutorial: **Relative Position**.

I wanted to take a few notes on this subject since it comes up all the time in my WordPress code. It's important to truly understand position so here we go.

## Read and learn!
